## 🔧 GitHub Pages Settings

Make sure your repository has the correct settings:

1. Go to: https://github.com/MohanMahesh10/BestHire/settings/pages
2. Under "Build and deployment":
   - **Source**: Should be "GitHub Actions" ✅
3. After first successful deploy, you'll see:
   - "Your site is published at https://mohanmahesh10.github.io/BestHire"

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If styling still doesn't show:

1. **Wait a bit longer** - GitHub Pages can take up to 5 minutes
2. **Hard refresh** - Ctrl + Shift + R multiple times
3. **Clear cache** - Use browser developer tools (F12) → Network tab → "Disable cache"
4. **Check Actions** - Make sure the workflow completed successfully
5. **Try incognito mode** - This bypasses all caching

### If you see a 404 error:

- Wait 5 more minutes - initial deployment takes longer
- Check that GitHub Pages is set to "GitHub Actions" source
