## 🔄 If Still Not Working

```

### Option 2: Clear browser cache
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Option 3: Try incognito/private mode
This ensures no cached files are interfering

## 📸 Current Status

Your deployment is ready! The files are on the `gh-pages` branch:
- ✅ Static files generated
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub
- ⏳ Waiting for Pages to be enabled

Once you enable GitHub Pages in settings, the site will be live immediately!

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If you see "404 - Page not found"
- Make sure you selected `gh-pages` branch (not `main`)
- Make sure folder is set to `/ (root)`
- Wait a few more minutes

### If styling is broken
- The site should work perfectly once Pages is enabled
- If not, let me know and I'll adjust the configuration
