# ✅ Production Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Validation

### 1. ML Algorithm Testing

```bash
# Open browser console at http://localhost:3000
# Paste and run:
```

```javascript
import { validateMLAlgorithms } from './src/lib/ml-validator';
validateMLAlgorithms();
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Parsing: 7/7 fields extracted (100%)
✅ Embedding: 5/5 checks passed (100%)
✅ Similarity: 5/5 checks passed (85.3%)
✅ Sentiment: 5/5 checks passed (100%)
✅ Performance: 250ms avg (3/3 checks passed)

📊 Overall Score: 97.1%
✅ All ML algorithms passed validation!
```

**Action**: If score < 90%, investigate failing tests

- [ ] Skills list populated (80%+ accuracy)
- [ ] Experience entries present
- [ ] Education entries present
- [ ] Sentiment score reasonable (0-100%)

#### Test Candidate Matching

---

### 3. Performance Testing

#### Speed Benchmarks

- [ ] Candidate matching: < 2 seconds (5 candidates)
- [ ] Page load: < 3 seconds
- [ ] Navigation: < 200ms transitions
- [ ] Analytics load: < 1 second

#### Stress Testing
- [ ] Upload 10 resumes → all parse successfully
- [ ] Match 20 candidates → completes quickly
- [ ] Rapid navigation → no crashes
- [ ] Clear localStorage → app resets cleanly

---

### 4. Cross-Browser Testing

#### Desktop
- [ ] Chrome (latest) - Works ✅
- [ ] Firefox (latest) - Works ✅
- [ ] Safari (latest) - Works ✅

---

### 5. Code Quality

```bash
# Run linter
npm run lint

# Expected: No errors
```

```bash
# Type check
npx tsc --noEmit

# Expected: No type errors
```

```bash
# Build test
npm run build

# Expected: Build successful
```

---

### 6. Accuracy Validation

#### Test with Real Resumes
- [ ] Test with 5 different real resumes
- [ ] Name accuracy: 90%+ ✅
- [ ] Email accuracy: 95%+ ✅
- [ ] Skills accuracy: 80%+ ✅
- [ ] Match scores reasonable ✅

#### Test Edge Cases
- [ ] Empty resume → doesn't crash
- [ ] Very long resume (>10 pages) → parses
- [ ] Resume with images → text extracted
- [ ] Non-English characters → handled gracefully
- [ ] Missing sections → partial data shown

---

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Final Build

```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules .next
npm install

# Production build
npm run build

# Test production locally
npm start
# Visit http://localhost:3000
# Test all features again
```

### Step 2: Environment Setup

```env
# .env.production (if needed)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Step 3: Deploy

#### Option A: Vercel (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

**Post-Deploy Checks:**
- [ ] Visit deployment URL
- [ ] Test resume upload
- [ ] Test matching
- [ ] Check analytics
- [ ] Verify health: `/api/health`

#### Option B: GitHub Pages

```bash
# Deploy
npm run deploy

# Enable Pages in GitHub Settings
```

**Post-Deploy Checks:**
- [ ] Visit GitHub Pages URL
- [ ] Test all features
- [ ] Check browser console for errors

---

## Post-Deployment Validation

### 1. Health Check

```bash
# Check health endpoint
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "checks": {
    "ml": true,
    "api": true,
    "storage": true
  }
}
```

### 2. Smoke Tests

- [ ] Homepage loads
- [ ] Can navigate to Upload
- [ ] Can upload a resume
- [ ] Can navigate to Match
- [ ] Can match candidates
- [ ] Can navigate to Analytics
- [ ] Analytics display correctly
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] No 404 errors

### 3. ML Algorithm Verification

Run validation again on production:
- [ ] Open production URL
- [ ] Open browser console
- [ ] Run `validateMLAlgorithms()`
- [ ] Verify all tests pass

---

## Monitoring Setup

### Key Metrics to Track

```typescript
// Add to your analytics
const metrics = {
  // Performance
  avgParsingTime: number,
  avgMatchingTime: number,
  pageLoadTime: number,
  
  // Usage
  totalResumes: number,
  totalMatches: number,
  activeUsers: number,
  
  // Quality
  avgMatchScore: number,
  avgSentimentScore: number,
  errorRate: number,
  
  // ML Health
  mlAccuracy: number,
  mlSuccessRate: number
};
```

### Alert Conditions

Set up alerts for:
- 🚨 Error rate > 5%
- ⚠️ Parsing time > 2 seconds
- ⚠️ Match time > 5 seconds
- 🚨 Health check fails
- 🚨 Zero match scores (potential ML failure)

---

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Detected

```bash
# Vercel rollback
vercel rollback

# Or redeploy previous version
git revert HEAD
git push
vercel --prod
```

### Emergency Fixes

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check `/api/health` endpoint
3. Test ML algorithms with validation
4. Check localStorage (might need clearing)
5. Verify API keys (if using Gemini)
